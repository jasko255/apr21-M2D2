      <span class="text-wrap">Trench is the fifth studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, released on October 5, 2018 through Fueled by Ramen. It is the band's first studio album in three years, after the breakthrough success of their previous album, Blurryface (2015). Recorded in secret during a year-long public silence, it is a concept album which explores mental health, suicide, and doubt, themes prominently featured in the band's previous works, framed in the metaphorical city of Dema and the surrounding valley known as "Trench".[1] The album was also the first release of the newly revived Elektra Music Group.

        <br> The album was preceded by the release of four singles. The first two, "Jumpsuit" and "Nico and the Niners", were both released on July 11, 2018. The third single, "Levitate", was released on August 8, 2018. The fourth single, "My Blood", was released August 27, 2018. Two more singles, "Chlorine" and "The Hype", were released on January 22 and July 16, 2019 respectively. To promote the album, the band embarked on The Bandito Tour, which began at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee on October 16, 2018.
        
       <br> Trench received acclaim from critics, who applauded its ambition, songwriting and more cohesive production; many contrasted it favorably with the band's previous album Blurryface. Several publications placed the record on their year-end lists, with Rock Sound naming it the best album of the year. It was also a commercial success, reaching number one in six countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Spain and the Netherlands, and number two in several countries, notably the United Kingdom and United States.</span>

<p>Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards.[1]

  The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[2][3] The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.[4]
  
  The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was released on October 5, 2018. Their sixth studio album, Scaled and Icy, is set to be released on May 21, 2021.
  
  The duo also has eight No. 1 songs on the Alternative Songs chart, making them the sixth artist with most number-one songs on the chart, behind Foo Fighters and tying with U2.</p>

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible) 
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it)

the worst album you ever listen to and everything related to the music you love.

IMPORTANT:
